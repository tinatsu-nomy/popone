# Changelog

[日本語](CHANGELOG.jp.md)

## v0.4.0 (2026-04-11)

Added a separate-window log viewer and reworked log file persistence around the principle that no log files are written unless the user explicitly asks for them or a panic occurs.

### New Features

- **Log Viewer (Separate OS Window)** — A new top-level "ログ" toolbar button now opens an independent OS window that streams the in-memory log buffer in real time. Built on `eframe`'s `show_viewport_deferred`, the log viewer is independent of the main 3D viewport: it can be moved to a different monitor, minimized separately, and does not force the main 3D scene to re-render when new log lines arrive (~150ms polling cadence inside the deferred closure).
- **Level Filter** — Toggle Error / Warn / Info / Debug visibility independently. Lines are color-coded (Error = red, Warn = yellow, Info = white, Debug / Trace = gray, Unknown = light gray). Multi-line messages such as backtraces are kept as a single logical entry.
- **Auto Tail Following** — When enabled, the view sticks to the bottom and scrolls as new lines arrive. Manually scrolling away pauses following; scrolling back to the bottom resumes it.
- **Manual Log Export** — A "ログ保存" button writes the current in-memory log to a user-chosen path via the native file dialog. A "フォルダを開く" button opens the logs directory in the OS file explorer.
- **Persistence** — Log viewer visibility, window position/size, and level filter state are saved to `popone.toml` (`[log_viewer]` section) and restored on next launch.

### Behavior Changes

- **No automatic log file generation on normal exit.** Previously the in-memory log buffer was flushed to `popone_<ts>.log` on every clean exit. v0.4.0 removes this; the buffer stays in memory and is discarded when the process exits cleanly. Use the new "ログ保存" button if you need to keep a session's logs.
- **Panic dumps go directly to `panic_<ts>.log`.** The previous "write to `popone_<ts>.log` then copy to `panic_<ts>.log`" path produced two files per crash. Now a single `panic_<ts>.log` is written.
- **Log rotation removed.** `rotate_logs` and the related `[log] keep` setting have been removed. Files in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\popone\logs\` now only exist as a result of explicit user action (manual export) or panics, so the auto-deletion bucket is no longer appropriate. Existing `popone.toml` files with a `[log] keep = N` line continue to load (the field is silently ignored).

### Internals

- New module `popone/src/viewer/log_viewer.rs` with handwritten `[HH:MM:SS.mmm][LEVEL] message` parser, ring buffer (20,000 line cap), incremental filter index, and 17 unit tests covering parser edge cases (multi-line concat, leading fragment after byte-level drain, CRLF, level filtering, geometry round-trip, in-session reopen).
- `LogViewerModel` is held behind `Arc<Mutex<LogViewerModel>>` so the `show_viewport_deferred` closure (which requires `Fn + Send + Sync + 'static`) can capture it via `Arc::clone`.
- Window position/size are captured every frame from the child viewport so the geometry round-trips correctly across in-session close/reopen and across process restarts.

## v0.3.0 (2026-04-11)

Initial public release. Focused on documentation MECE restructuring, UX improvements, and UnityPackage-related bug fixes.
